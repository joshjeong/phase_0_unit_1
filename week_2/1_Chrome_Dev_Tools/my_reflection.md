# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
   - No problem with DOM yet! It looks like it could get sticky as we dig deeper though.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
  - I viewed their elements and collected their JavaScript Profile.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
  - I found it to be extremely useful. It's surprised me that after being on chrome so long that I didn't even know it had all these features.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
  - Mine was understanding the steps and process of how a website loads it's page. Network tab in Chrome Web Tools helped click it for me.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
