# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
  - I think responsive web design is great! They enable sites to be adjusted to the format of the screen and scaled appropriately.
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
  - Yes, because there are now several sizes of screens, web developers have to be concious of what their viewers may be using. Who knows- in the future there may be curved or 3d screens that require a different layout.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
  - The color scheme or font size may be different for them. Although it may be a minority compared to all web users, I believe responsive web sites helps cater to them by allowing them to increase font size without completely ruining the layout.
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
  - I never knew that there were fuild, adaptive, fixed, or responsive sites. What doesn't make sense is why all sites aren't responsive web design?!
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
