# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
  - I think the biggest challenge will be completing the projects in time while keeping sane.
* How will you combat that? 
  - Hopefully by not being overwhelmed and controlling my anxiety.
* What techniques will you try?
  - I'm willing to try anything to see how I react to it such as meditation, frogger, or pomodoro. I heard DBC has yoga so I'm kind of curious to see if that will help relax my state.
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
  - To take things in increments, draw up plans, and pace myself accordingly.
