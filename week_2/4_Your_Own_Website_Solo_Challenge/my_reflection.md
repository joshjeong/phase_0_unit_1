Discuss the following in your reflection:

* What did you learn about design and user experience?
  - I feel much more comfortable dealing with CSS and am keeping in mind things such as having a responsive website.
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
  - Yes, so far I like how it's coming along. It's following the general outline I had for the wireframe but there's still a lot of room for improving how the design and color scheme.
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
  - I like drawing out the wireframe before hand. Almost like writing an outline before an essay.
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
  - Definitely the combination of colors and maybe some alignment.
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
  - Not at all. I did have to refer to some of my notes but I'm excited to already see some progress.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
